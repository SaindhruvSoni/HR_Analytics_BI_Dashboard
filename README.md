# HR_Analytics_BI_Dashboard
In the development of our HR dashboard, we have dedicated significant effort to meeting our clientâ€™s requirements. Specifically, our client seeks a comprehensive dashboard with distinct key performance indicators (KPIs) centered around employee attrition within the organization. The goal is to provide a detailed report on the various factors contributing to attrition. By doing so, our client can make informed decisions, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall workforce retention.
